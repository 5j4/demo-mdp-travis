<p>The <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> project benefits from expert advice and support from a large group of experienced Project Partners.</p>

<p>The project’s International Advisory Board (IAB) which works to ensure that the research undertaken is of the highest international standards and will facilitate transfer to the UK of lessons from global research and practice.  The IAB will meet annually in order to review the direction of the research, advise on how the research is conducted and on how the research impact can be maximised in the UK and internationally.</p>

<p>In order to maximise the benefits from having these prestigious international researchers in the UK, the <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> project will host Symposia which will be open to all interested parties, hopefully in partnership with other projects in the [UK Droughts &amp; Water Scarcity Programme](http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/funded/programmes/droughts/){:target="_blank"}, which is run by the UK Research councils.

<p>Droughts and water scarcity jointly pose a substantial threat to the environment, agriculture, infrastructure, society and culture in the UK, yet our ability to characterise and predict their occurrence, duration and intensity, as well as minimise their impacts, is often inadequate.</p>

<p>In <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> we developed new methodologies and models for analysis of the impacts of water scarcity on ecosystems, society and various economic activities including agriculture, industry and household consumers. By supporting the analysis of a full range of impacts in a common framework <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> provides multi-attribute characterisation of drought impacts and evidence to evaluate trade-offs between different impacts.</p>

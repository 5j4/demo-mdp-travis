<ul>
  <li>Assess public water supply vulnerability in Thames basin in presence of climate change with and without water quality constraints.</li>
  <li>Energy consumption in public water supply systems, case study Thames basin.</li>
  <li>Changes of water availability for abstractors (Agriculture, energy, PWS and etc.) in drought for England (national scale).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The general question I am trying to address is the impacts of drought and water scarcity on abstractors generally and PWS specifically. It can be determined only based on water quantity or integrated with water quality. In that case, we will look at how much water availability may change for PWS in dry years.</p>

<h2 id="research-methods">Research methods</h2>

<p>The Thames water resource system in WATHNET has been developed. With this is platform it will be integrated with water quality and energy consumption model.</p>

<p>Our approach is risk-based which means we will run the model for many number of scenarios (i.e. 1000) and we will extract statistical outputs of these scenarios.</p>

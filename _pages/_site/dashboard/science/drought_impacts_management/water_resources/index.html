<h2 id="water-resources">Water Resources</h2>

<p>A water resources system model has been developed for the Thames basin and other large public water supplies in England. The model has been developed using the WATHNET system. The model is being used to simulate water availability and allocation. It uses hydrology and estimates of water demand for different uses from elsewhere in the <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> project.</p>

  <li>A scenario building workshop develops explorative scenarios for drought management and offers the opportunity for unconstrained blue sky thinking about drought management options based on the question, <em>What can happen?</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>One element of the <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> project is to explore and review options for drought management practice in England &amp; Wales beyond the existing regulatory framework and to discuss qualitatively the potential effectiveness of and constraints upon these options with stakeholders. Therefore, a scenario building workshop is organised and offers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the possibility to develop explorative scenarios for drought management</li>
  <li>the opportunity for unconstrained blue sky thinking about drought management options based on the question <em>What can happen</em>?
to be useful in cases where there is fairly good knowledge regarding how the system works at present, but one is interested in exploring the consequences of alternative developments in drought management</li>
  <li>The scenario building workshop is an interactive workshop bringing together different stakeholders’ and researchers’ perspectives on drought management.</li>

<p><strong>Explorative Scenario Building Workshop</strong></p>

<p>The workshop has an interactive format and requires active participation from every participant and involves small group discussions as well as plenary discussions. Methodologically the workshop follows the following outline:</p>

<ul>
  <li>introduction and definition of problem frame, e.g.: resilient drought management in England &amp; Wales</li>
  <li>identification and grouping of “drivers” for future management of drought (e.g.: population growth)</li>
  <li>selection of relevant drivers for scenario development</li>
  <li>scenario description based on critical drivers</li>
  <li>ßscenario story lines (first ideas)</li>
</ul>

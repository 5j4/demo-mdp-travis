<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Algal blooms in reservoirs are a potentially serious problem for water quality.  Certain types, such as cyanobacteria (“blue-green algae”), have the potential to produce harmful toxins.</p>

<h2 id="research-methods">Research methods</h2>

<p>An algal community model (PROTECH) was applied to simulate the algae of a reservoir under numerous scenarios.  The occurrence of blooms and cyanobacteria abundance was quantified.</p>

<p>Predicting the total chlorophyll concentration in reservoir over a range of Thames River flows and reservoir surface water temperatures over the period of June-September (the main growing season).</p>

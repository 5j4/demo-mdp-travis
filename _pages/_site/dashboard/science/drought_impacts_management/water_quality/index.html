<p>Water quality in rivers and reservoirs is seriously affected by drought. How flows reduce dilution raises nutrient concentrations qhich stimulates algal growth. Increased temperatures affect disolved oxygen concentrations again impacting ecology. Chemical kinetics also change in droughts affecting metals, organic and contaminents. Water resources can be impacted by water quality issues.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Increased water scarcity will lead to changes in agricultural landuse as relative crop and farm profitability change within the UK and Europe.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Effects of long term yield and profit variability influence farm business planning and investment, for example affecting crop and rotation selection, investment in infrastructure for irrigation and fodder storage, livestock numbers, etc. MaRIUS aims to understand how long term farm planning will change due to increased water scarcity; and the impacts and response of farmers, processors and food retailers to drought.</p>

<h2 id="research-methods">Research methods</h2>
<p>Simulation of UK landuse response to increased water scarcity, arising from changing relative crop and farm profitability, within a Pan-European integrated modelling platform. The model was validated by comparison of observed current and simulated land use (see figure 1). Additionally the division of agricultural land by crop type was assessed by comparision with EUROSTAT agricultural data (Figure 2). 
The model was then simulated with a combination of temperature and precipitation perturbations from the baseline to indicate potential land use and agricultural land use change within the UK under a range of future climate scenarios.</p>

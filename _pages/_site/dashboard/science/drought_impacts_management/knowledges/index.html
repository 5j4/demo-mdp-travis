<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The Human Geography team has investigated knowledge about drought and water scarcity in the UK using three distinct approaches.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Firstly, we have interviewed a wide range of people who engage with drought and water scarcity issues professionally, some by doing scientific research, others involved in policy making and regulation, yet others working in the water industry and finally some representing environmental organisations. This interview study, supplemented with documentation from the organisations employing the interviewees, has enabled mapping of the landscape of expertise and decision making surrounding the <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> project.</li>
  <li>Secondly, we have conducted fieldwork in two localities in the Thames Basin. Ethnographic observation of water related activities in the localities has been combined with interviews and retrieval of locally produced and archived documents. This fieldwork has generated insights regarding how local communities understand drought and water scarcity in their area.</li>
  <li>Thirdly, we have brought formal scientific expertise together with local experience-based expertise in a local experiment with co-producing knowledge through an Environmental Competency Group. Focussing on the upper river Kennet this effort has highlighted the ways in which local communities can increase water resilience through the local planning process.</li>

  <li>Future synthetic drought event set: 100 weather time series for near and far future conditions that could occur, using weather@home 2, i.e., the regional climate model HadRM3P driven by its global counterpart, the global climate model HadAM3P (same setup as the “baseline” described <a href="/drought_climatology/20c/">here</a>).</li>

<p>To estimate future drought risk, a synthetic event set for future time period has been generated, following a similar setup as for the <a href="/drought_climatology/20c/">synthetic baseline event set</a> : a global climate model, (HadAM3P, the parent global model of HadRMP), driven by observed sea surface temperature is used to drive HadRM3P (using the <a href="http://www.climateprediction.net/weatherathome/">weather@home</a> distributed climate modelling system).</p>

<p>The future event set provides a range of possible weather time series that could occur in the near future (2020-2049) and far future (2070-2099). Projections are based on the high-emission greenhouse gas scenario RCP 8.5. Years 1975-2004 in the past are used as a reference: volcanoes and sea surface temperature anomalies are taken from those years, with a projected warming added onto the latter. The uncertainty of the climate response is included by considering 5 scenarios of ocean warming: an average scenario (multi-model median of coupled climate model warming) and 4 extreme scenarios, with high/low global average warming and high/low change in North Atlantic sea surface temperature gradients, sampled from the CMIP5 ensemble. About a hundred time series have been produced for each scenario and time slice, leading to a total of 10 sets of a hundred 30-year time series.</p>

<p>Projections show that the temperature increase is most pronounced in summer. For precipitation, winters get wetter while summers become summer dryer, which has implications for droughts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Estimates of the economic impact of droughts are generally developed in the absence of an explicit conceptual framework.</li>
  <li>A framework to empirically estimate the economic impacts of future droughts under a range of different climate and policy scenarios has been developed. These scenarios take account of different assumptions regarding a drought event, including: the source of the drought (green or blue water), temporality, and critically, long-term and short-term policy-making choices.</li>
  <li>For hypothetical scenarios, applying this framework to the UK economy we estimate that, depending on the severity of the drought event and short-term policy choices, the impacts could range from 0.35% to 4.3% of total output.</li>
  <li>Different long-term policy choices could mitigate these impacts for drought events with similar severity and duration.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Economic impacts of drought can be large and far-ranging. The quantification of the potential scale of economic losses during droughts is important to inform trade-offs between uses of water and to help decision makers understand the scale of economic risks and need for investment and regulatory action. The economic impacts of past droughts and more extreme simulated droughts on specific sectors is assessed, providing output measures such as: changes in relative input or production costs; and changes in relative final output or production levels. Analysis of the economic impacts of droughts has focused upon domestic and commercial water consumers and upon major industrial abstractors, notably electricity generation. This is important as in England and Wales, the electricity sector is responsible for 40% of non-tidal surface water abstractions. When sufficient cooling is not possible, power station operators are required to ‘ramp down’ the generation output in order to reduce cooling demand. The risk of this occurring is computed.</p>

<h2 id="research-methods">Research methods</h2>

<p>A limitation of most empirical studies on economic impacts of drought is that they are not applied within an explicit assessment framework that sets out the important characteristics of droughts, such as temporality, the hydraulic capital stock (or storage and production capacity) and the policy decisions, before the drought event and during it. Freire-González et al. (2016) argue that these factors can be critical determinants of the economic impacts of droughts, and that a wider conceptual framework is needed within which the macroeconomic method can be applied.</p>

<p>A new analytical framework was developed, to capture all the factors that contribute to, or mitigate against, the economic costs or impacts of a drought (including policy-making, planning and management actions).</p>

<p>The main elements of the framework are: 
1.	Sources of economic impact of drought: differentiating between green water and blue water is needed for a full assessment of the impacts of a drought event, its dynamics and its socio-economic impacts.
2.	 Climate conditions: have a direct impact on green water, but can also impact on blue water sources. However, climate conditions do not always fully affect socio-economic systems. This is because of changes in the climate can be mitigated by the use of blue water in a specific region, or in other words, the capacity to store, produce or transfer water. This capacity depends on the amount and composition of the hydraulic stock of capital and the socio-political environment. 
3.	Policy-making and infrastructure: long-term and short-term policy decisions about the allocation, level and composition of blue water resources can be critical determinants of the economic impacts of droughts. 
4.	 Dynamics: most of these aspects are interrelated in a dynamic framework. Drought dynamics can comprise different levels: 
	a.	Drought duration (short-term)
	b.	Drought adaptation (long-term)
5.	Economic analysis tools: comprise the specific mathematical, statistical and other quantitative and qualitative tools used to assess the economic impacts of a drought event.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 shows how these elements are integrated within a scenario-based framework to empirically estimate the short-term economic impacts of a drought event.</p>

<p><img src="/mariusdroughtproject.org/assets/img/Katie1.png" alt="Katie1.png" /></p>

<p>Based on this framework, a direct economic impact model estimates the relationship between the hydrologic factors and various economic indicators. This analysis uses an I-O model based on the 2007 EXIOBASE dataset - a global, detailed multi-regional environmentally extended I-O database. The I-O table for the UK includes 163 sectors with high disaggregation for agriculture. This dataset includes water accounts amongst other environmental extensions, differentiating between green water use and blue water use. So it provides information on the different water uses for each economic sector.</p>

<p>Three types of scenarios are used to estimate impacts within the framework: 1) assumptions about how drought impacts on the availability of green water available to keep soil moist; 2) assumptions about the amount of blue water available for abstractors; and 3) decisions that policy-makers take, applying water restrictions to specific agents when managing blue water resources. The combination of the climate scenarios and the policy scenarios will collectively determine the final economic impact of a given drought event.</p>

<p>We have identified three hypothetical drought events: a low severity drought, a medium severity drought and a high severity drought. Each drought event assumes different hypothetical reductions in green water and blue water, and assumes a specific fixed level and composition of hydraulic capital stock for the UK. Specifically, we have applied our framework to estimate economic impacts for 10 different policy scenarios, from less restrictive to more restrictive ones.</p>

<p>For each of the scenarios identified the indirect and economy-wide impacts have been estimated applying the I-O method. A supply-side I-O model has been developed which models how GVA changes in response to variation in water availability of different economic sectors.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>Fig. 2 shows the aggregated output losses over the UK economy for the 30 different hypothetical climate and policy scenarios. Losses range from 0.35% to 4.3% of total output of the UK economy. These results are in line with existing empirical literature in other contexts and using other methods.
As might be expected, more extreme drought events and policy responses are more likely to have greater short-term impacts on total output. For example, a high severity drought scenario, coupled with severe restrictions in blue water availability (scenario 10), results in the greatest reduction of total output.</p>

<p>Fig. 2. Total output losses in the UK economy under different climate and policy scenarios.</p>

<p>A first insight from this analysis is that for a given climatic condition, say a high severity drought, the economic impact can vary significantly depending on policy choices. For example, in times of a high severity drought, applying the restrictions associated with scenario 1 will result in total economic losses of 0.6%, while applying the restrictions associated with scenario 10 will result in a 4.3% reduction in total output.</p>

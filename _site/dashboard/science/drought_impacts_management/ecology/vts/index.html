      Vulnerability of tree species

      <p>## Key science findings</p>

<ul>
  <li>A process-based dynamic vegetation model (i.e. LPJ-GUESS) is parameterized and applied to Great Britain to simulate drought-induced tree mortality. The projected results show that, in the Thames Basin, two periods (2030 to 2034 and 2083 to 2084) appear to have higher risks for beech and oak to be affected by droughts.</li>
  <li>Spatially, beech is more susceptible to drought than oak especially in the southeast Thames Basin. Amongst the sub-catchments of the Thames, the Wey and Colne appear to be particularly affected under all climate scenarios, whereas the western Thames is less affected. The level of drought impacts on beech is slightly increased in the 2080s compared to the 2030s.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Forest is a very important ecosystem for carbon storage, water regulation, watershed protection and biodiversity. Recent literature has reported drought-induced mortality and dieback of forests in different regions across the world. In Great Britain, the mean summer temperature is projected to rise by 3°C to 4°C in the 2080s due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, however, the potential impacts on tree species and forests are not well understood. There is thus a need to assess the vulnerability of British tree species to drought in order to provide scientific information to aid effective forest management and habitat conservation in adaptation to climate change. Marius has analysed the temporal and spatial patterns of the potential impacts and vulnerability of important British forest species to drought.</p>

<h2 id="research-methods">Research methods</h2>

<p>We applied a version of the LPJ-GUESS (a process-based dynamic vegetation-terrestrial ecosystem) model parameterized for 18 European tree species and/or plant functional types to simulate vegetation dynamics across Great Britain for the period 1961 to 2011. In LPJ-GUESS, tree mortality was considered to be partly a function of water stress leading to reduced growth-efficiency and increasing age.  The Z-score of the simulated mortality was used to compare the mortality severity in any year ignoring any long-term trend for each species and different time periods. Thus, a positive Z-score above a specified threshold indicated a potential impact of drought of concern.</p>

<h2 id="result-1">Result 1</h2>

<p>The heatmap (Figure 1) indicates the probability of British beech and oak in the Thames Basin being affected by future drought under climatic uncertainty. These two selected tree species are most probably to be affected in a period from 2030 to 2034, with beech showing a relatively higher risk than oak in the same year. In the 2080s, 2083 and 2084 are both projected as having a relatively higher drought risk for both species. The results should not be interpreted as precise predictions, but rather that there will be periods in the future with a higher risk of drought-induced tree mortality which could affect woodland structure and functioning.</p>

<h2 id="result-2">Result 2</h2>

<p>The vulnerability map (Figure 2) shows the spatial pattern of drought-induced tree mortality levels across the Thames Basin in the 2030s and 2080s. The indicator is based on the percentage change of the summation of the overall mortality Z-score (i.e. larger than 1) relative to baseline. Generally, beech is more susceptible to drought than oak especially in the southeast Thames Basin. The level of drought impact on beech is slightly increased in the 2080s compared to that in the 2030s, whereas the similar trend is not evident for oak. Amongst the sub-catchments, the Wey and Colne appear to be particularly affected under almost all climate scenarios, followed by London for oak. The western sub-catchments (e.g. Kennet and Cotswolds) are less affected.</p>
